# Sorting_Algorithm
This is a number crunching algorithm which uses single bit mutation to train the algorithm to be as accurate as possible.
The purpose of this algorithm was to take in a specificed input, assign a number of these values to a test set, And uses
the rest of the numbers as a training set. Once the algorithm is trained, we then run through the test set and see how
close the algoritghm is to the values we are trying to find. If this is within an acceptiable standard deviation, we then
introduce the algorithm to a real data set where we dont know the output. This calculates the output based off the
training.
